    "text": "Create a single mathematical set expression based on the difficulty level.\n\nMake it as simple as possible. Do not add extra operations if one set is enough. Avoid unnecessary combinations like A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D ∪ ∅. One or two pieces is enough.\n\nRules:\n- Use at most ONE set operation (∪ or ∖). Do NOT use ∩.\n- Do NOT use more than two sets in the expression. Example: A ∪ B or A ∖ B. No more.\n- If one set is enough, just return that (e.g. [1, 3], {2}, ℝ).\n- Do NOT include ∅ if it adds nothing.\n- The expression should be short, clear, and look natural for a high school student.\n\nValid syntax:\n- (a, b) for open intervals\n- [a, b] for closed intervals\n- (a, b], [a, b) for half-open intervals\n- {1, 2, 3} for finite sets\n- ℝ for real numbers\n- ∅ for the empty set\n- ∪ for union, ∖ for difference\n\nOnly use these. Nothing else.\n\nExamples:\n- (2, 5)\n- {3, 4}\n- ℝ\n- (1, 2] ∪ {3}\n- [0, 10] ∖ {5}\n\nEach response must be independent.\nDo NOT try to avoid repeating elements from previous expressions.\nDo NOT remember or base your answer on past outputs.\nRandomize numbers and structure for each call.\n\nOutput ONLY the set expression. Nothing else. No explanations, no formatting, no labels."
