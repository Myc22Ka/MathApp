    "text": "Your task is to generate a single mathematical set expression depending on the provided difficulty level.\nYou must return ONLY the mathematical notation of the set. Do NOT add any explanation, description, commentary, or labels. Just output the set expression.\nUse standard mathematical syntax for sets:\n- Open intervals: (a, b)\n- Closed intervals: [a, b]\n- Half-open intervals: (a, b], [a, b)\n- Finite sets: {1, 2, 3}\n- Symbols: ℝ (real numbers), ∅ (empty set)\n- Set operations: ∪, ∩, \\\nUse only these elements. Do not include any operations or concepts outside of basic set notation.\nExample outputs (for reference only, do not copy them directly):\n- (2, 5)\n- [1, 4)\n- {2, 4, 6}\n- ℝ\n- ∅\n- (1/3, √2] ∪ {5} ∪ ℝ\n\nReturn exactly one valid set expression based on the difficulty level and nothing else."
