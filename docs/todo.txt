1. In order to create generator of sets I need to get:
- Generator of numbers: not started
- Sets logic: done
- Generator of sets:
    depth - how many operations are in set
    difficulty - specifies how difficult numbers are
    random or specified brackets

2. Endpoints Bugs: Templates, Exercises
* Exercises
    - Math Expressions aren't generated in parsed form.                                         +
    - For creating exercises I need to check why I go null in text response of an exercise      +
    - UPDATE endpoint I need to provide list of values                                          ?
    - CREATING endpoint needs to run through math parser                                        +
    - When generating/creating exercise I should be able to pass variant as ID
* Templates
    - Checking validity of updating things in UPDATE endpoint
    - DELETE endpoint doesn't work due to constrains                                            +
* Variants
    - Simple CRUD like existing one in Templates                                                +
